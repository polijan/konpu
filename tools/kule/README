Simple home-made Color and Image tools
--------------------------------------

Tools that help the creation of ilo Konpu or complement it.
They allow:

- creation and analysis of "uniform" palettes,
- creation of the "best" palette for a given image,
- dithering an image in various ways,
- etc.

The tools work in the OkLab perceptual color space.
