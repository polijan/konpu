**ilo Konpu** is a [retro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_computer "retro")-style computing environment with native support for [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona "Toki Pona").

## In Short

- Tiny and Retro-styled (we're talking about kilobytes, not megabytes)
- Simple multimedia access: provides a canvas that works well for text-oriented applications (with capabilities similar to a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator "terminal emulator")) while also offering the ability to do graphics (via [attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_clash) or full bitmapped modes)  and sounds.
- Native support for (printable) ASCII and  [Sitelen Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitelen_Pona) (with efficient string encoding, input method, bitmap font rendering)
- Simple but rich [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28(programming_language%29)) API for writing efficient apps (and games).
- **Waso**, a custom programming language and shell interpreter (inspired by Toki Pona and [RPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPL_%28programming_language%29)) to interact with your environment or write powerful scripts and apps.

## Status

Early work in progress.
