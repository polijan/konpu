CONTENT OF THE DIRECTORY:

jtckdint-1.0/
   From: https://github.com/jart/jtckdint
   Header providing the C23 Checked Arithmetic functionalities.
   Not tested. Code is activated only when using another compiler than GCC or
   CLANG, and when C standard is prior to C23.
   TODO: Probably should be removed as target for Konpu will be either C23 or
         GCC/CLANG (which has builtins for that). Removing this will also
         simplify the konpu*.h dev headers.

pcg-c-basic-0.9/
   From: https://www.pcg-random.org/
   The PCG random number generator (RNG). Supposed to be simple, fast, good.
   Minimal C Implementation, 0.9
   Embedded in the Core where it is used as the main RNG for Konpu.

sokol/
   From: https://github.com/floooh/sokol
   Minimal cross-platform standalone graphic library.
   Used as konpu backend

termbox2/
   From: https://github.com/termbox/termbox2
   Single-header-style small terminal I/O library. It is a slim alternative to
   the ubiquitous ncurses library. Unlike ncurses, it has a tighter API, and
   comes with built-in support for popular terminals if a terminfo db is not
   present on the system.
